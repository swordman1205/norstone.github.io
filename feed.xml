Romans used stacked stone walls in Europe to mark territories and some can still be found today. In New England you can find walls from early settlers that are moss covered and blending into tree lines.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/New England Stacked Stone Wall.png&quot; alt=&quot;New England Stacked Stone Wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In days past, people would use the stones they had available, hand cutting and laying stones. A traditional stacked stone wall might not even use a bonding agent like concrete. Stones would be laid so carefully that the weight of the stones and their positioning in the wall is what held them together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process was very labor intensive and still is. Even with precut slabs of stone, it takes professional masons to deliver a quality finish. Over time people came to love the look and incorporated it in columns, cladding homes, building fireplaces and other design details. Seen as a sign of wealth due to the need for both mass amounts of material and skilled labor the stack stone look became coveted the world around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stunning quality of stacked stone is the unique look it has. Built from stones of all different sizes and often a natural spectrum of color stack stone has a raw yet refined look. Fast forward to today, stacked stone is one of the most popular contemporary design looks. Advances in manufacturing make it possible to expertly mount stones to wall panels. This makes it possible to quickly and easily incorporate stacked stone into a variety of designs with far less labor.

&lt;p&gt;Stacked stone veneer is a very affordable alternative to achieve a very contemporary look. Our stone wall panels offer advantages at for designers. Our master masons select the highest grade stone from ethical quarries, looking at consistency of color and density of rock. Then we process the stone in a very traditional fashion, cutting different thicknesses to give finished stone tiles a three dimensional aspect. All stones are hand placed for that perfect tight stack look. This minimizes the need for mortar allowing for the stone itself to shine.

&lt;p&gt;With Norstone natural stacked stone panels we have innovated an intuitive installation process. Our stone veneer tiles feature a unique finger and groove for seamless installation. The benefits of our interlocking stone panel system are the most visible or maybe invisible on corners. No mitering and every panel lines up maintaining the consistent look of the stone, as if a master mason had laid them.
While there are many products listed as stacked stone on the market, on natural stone will retain its original beauty year after year. The color it has today will not be diminished from exposure to the sun or elements. While stacked stone has a long history, Norstone’s stacked stone panels are one of a kind.

It’s also foot to foot the most expensive room to design, build or remodel, so we are talking about a major investment even if it’s the only space you are working on. At Norstone, we work with our customers everyday on &lt;a href=&quot;/gallery/application/backsplash/&quot;&gt;stacked stone backsplashes&lt;/a&gt; that range in looks from rustic, using our &lt;a href=&quot;/products/rock-panels/ochre/&quot;&gt;Ochre Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt;, to uber – modern, with our &lt;a href=&quot;/products/modern-wall-tile/&quot;&gt;Basalt Interlocking Tiles&lt;/a&gt;. A trend we’re seeing lots of kitchens using is to extend their countertop surface to the backsplash. This can be used to create a more dynamic and bold looking kitchen, create a durable backsplash, and highlight the beauty of the material on a vertical surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Marble-Tile-Backsplash---Onyx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Onyx backsplash&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;Of the thousands of choices of slab sized natural stone that could be used for this type of application, including soapstone, slate, onyx, limestone, there are three stones that completely dominate all other materials in popularity when it comes to use as a kitchen backsplash - granite, marble and quartz. Even though design styles are constantly changing and evolving, granite, quartz, or marble tile backsplashes always have a huge fan base as favorites amongst designers, architects and builders. Of the big 3, one stands out as the leader when it comes to overall quality - quartz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Marble-Tile-Backsplash---Quartz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Quartz backsplash&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;A large part in quartz being such a top quality go-to material is its incredible durability and highly sought after characteristics. Compared to a granite or marble tile backsplash, quartzite is actually much more resistant to stains and acids (etching), more scratch resistant, heat resistant, and easier to care for overall which means less maintenance and more economical over time. Quartz also requires less sealing over time than a granite or marble tile backsplash and has a much more uniform and pure look over all. And one of my personal favorite reasons to love quartz is that it doesn’t harbor bacteria – a clean kitchen is a healthy kitchen! That’s just the short list, but all powerful reasons to consider this wonderful material when designing a kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Marble-Tile-Backsplash---Quartz2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Quartz backsplash&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;In comparison to a marble tile backsplash, quartz outperforms in the maintenance department. Marble tends to stain easily due to being very porous, and thus requires a higher rate of sealing than quartz. A marble tile backsplash can also easily scratch, and does not fare very well when left in contact with acidic foods or liquids since they can eat away at the surface finish.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary>Granite, Marble, Quartz – the big three when it comes to high end stone countertop material.

One of the biggest differences between the two is with respect to color variation, so let’s dig a little deeper into each of these products to understand what the advantages are for each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Ceramic-Wall-Tile---Natural-Stone-Veneer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Natural stone veneer&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;From a color variation standpoint, natural stone is almost always admired for its inherently unique characteristics. Whether it’s subtle variation in the color of the stone, veining, or faceting, there are a number of things that make each and every piece of natural stone unique. It is this uniqueness that creates a draw and puts value on natural stone products in the marketplace. At Norstone, we encourage our customers to embrace the uniqueness of natural stone and the color variations it brings in products like our &lt;a href=&quot;/products/rock-panels/ochre/&quot;&gt;Ochre Blend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/products/rock-panels/ivory/&quot;&gt;Ivory&lt;/a&gt; Rock Panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flip side of the argument with natural stone is that some people will be looking for a less varied, more consistent look. While this person might be enamored with the idea of having a natural stone backsplash, the idea of rose colored vein running through their White Quartz keeps them up at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Ceramic-Wall-Tile---Kitchen-Backsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kitchen backsplash&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;For those unable or unwilling to accept the color variations in natural stone, manmade tile products like porcelain and ceramic wall tile are a great alternative. Since these products are manmade, there is control over the output in terms of color and any other variation. Ceramic wall tile buyers can be reasonably assured that when they buy tile from a quality manufacturer, that the product will be consistent from a color, dimensional, and build standpoint. However, just like natural stone, manmade tile products will vary from batch to batch, so always be sure to order enough to complete your job and account for waste when working on any tile or stone project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Ceramic-Wall-Tile---Natural-Stone-Look.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Natural stone look&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;In general the subtlety and uniqueness that only Mother Nature can provide is more desirable in the stone and tile industry, and most people see and appreciate the natural beauty it creates. In fact is so desirable that the manmade tile industry has spent millions on creating floor and wall tile products that are made to look like natural stone. Just stop in your local tile shop and look at the ceramic wall tile section and you’ll see a variety of tiles made to mimic natural stone. However, manmade tile products like porcelain and ceramic wall tile are a good alternative for someone needing a more consistent color range to work from. So wherever you fall in the spectrum of color variation, know that there is a good product out there for your next wall covering project and plenty of good people at Norstone and your local tile shops that can help guide you through the selection process.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary>There are many differences between manmade tile products, like porcelains and ceramics, as compared to natural stone. One of the most noticeable is color variation – something that can be tightly controlled when tile is manufactured versus something Mother Nature dictates when it comes to natural stone.

It can tie together your cabinets, countertops and bring forth the general aesthetic of the space. Today, your backsplash options are endless. Some might be fads that fade fast, but exploring the current trends is inspiring, exciting, and the first step in finding what you’ll fall in love with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Backsplash-Tile-Designs---E&amp;amp;S.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;E&amp;amp;S&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;One trend that we are seeing, and not just in backsplashes but throughout whole house design, is earth friendly products. Renewable, recycled and environmentally safe products make for a greener house, and we are not talking about the color! You can even make sure your backsplash is green by using a product such as these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/eandstile/&quot;&gt;barnwood tiles&lt;/a&gt; from E&amp;amp;S Tile. These unique backsplash tile designs are made from recycled barnwood gathered from 80 year old barns and distilleries. They are finished with a low VOC ceramic coating for easy cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Backsplash-Tile-Designs---Stainless-Steel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stainles steel&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;Another trend that we are noticing is stainless steel backsplashes. Stainless steel is as efficient and low maintenance as it is stylish. It offers a number of advantages, ranging from durability to the fact that it can be integrated into just about any kitchen design to coordinate with most appliances. Like the appliances, the stainless steel backsplash tile design is sleek but refined and a great option for anyone looking to add both visual interest and efficiency to their kitchen.  Stainless steel is available in both tiles as well as larger cut to fit sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Backsplash-Tile-Designs---Subway-Tile.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Subway tile&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;When talking about backsplash trends, you can’t leave out the trusty, long loved subway tile. With the revival of vintage and shabby chic, the subway tile is making a comeback. The classic, understated look of a subway tile is extremely versatile. It can be paired with just about any kitchen style, from traditional to hyper-modern. The subway tile comes in an endless variety of materials, colors and textures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Backsplash-Tile-Designs---Stacked-Stone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stacked stone&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;Another great trend in backsplashes is the use of natural stone. Technically this could fall into the earth friendly category, but they are so unique and beautiful, I thought they should stand on their own. Of course you can go with a traditional slate or travertine tile, but what we are seeing today is the use of drystacked ledge stones like Norstone’s [Rock Panels]/products/stacked-stone-cladding/)&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;. These panels take the old and make it new. They bring the outdoors in while providing a versatile pallet that coordinates well with traditional or modern design. They provide rawness to the space that really fits in a kitchen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A backsplash is a chance to really bring out the personality of a kitchen. It is the finishing touch, the cherry on the top. Research the various materials that are out there and find the one that best fits you and the space and most importantly, have fun with it!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary>Think of your kitchen or bath backsplash as a canvas where you can express your own creativity or embrace the latest trends in backsplash tile design, without the same cost and construction commitment as other elements of the space, like cabinets and countertops.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Stacked-Stone-Backsplash-Bathroom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stacked stone backsplash bathroom&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;font-weight:lighter;letter-spacing:1px&quot;&gt;Norstone Rock Panels are a great option for a unique stacked stone backsplash in your kitchen or bath.&lt;/span&gt; With a range of colors to choose from, your &lt;a href=&quot;/gallery/application/backsplash/&quot;&gt;backsplash&lt;/a&gt;can either serve as the perfect complement or accent feature in the space. One of the questions we hear a lot when working with our customers is how to work with the stone around electrical outlets and light switches. Here’s a quick rundown of what we’ve found most helpful when addressing those breaks in your backsplash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Modern-Stacked-Stone-Backsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Modern stacked stone backsplash&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depth&lt;/strong&gt; - the first thing you’ll want to consider is the depth of your current outlets and light switches against the stone. &lt;a href=&quot;/products/stacked-stone-cladding/&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Norstone Rock Panel&lt;/a&gt;s will vary between about .75” and 1.75” thick, so a common solution to minimize the recess of the existing outlet against the face of the stone is to add a 1/2” outlet box extender, which will screw into your existing wall box and provide you with new mounting holes to remount the outlets and switches. Most of the time outlets and switches will remain slightly recessed of the face of the stone, but larger extenders can be used to position them closer to flush with the stone face. Extenders are available in the electrical section of most hardware stores and remember whenever you are working with electricity, shut off the power to that switch / outlet first and use a tester to make sure the outlet isn’t powered prior to beginning work. When in doubt. always consult a licensed electrician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Stacked-Stone-Backsplash-Outlet-Detail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stacked stone backsplash outlet detail&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cuts&lt;/strong&gt; - the easiest way to cut a hole in a stacked stone backsplash for an outlet or light switch is to have a one panel terminate into the side of the outlet, and cut the opening out of the adjoining piece. If you look closely at the picture to the right, you’ll see the switch buts up on the right side against a full panel, and then the opening for the switch has been cut out of a second panel which goes above, below, and continues along to the left of the switch. This method is recommended since it only requires a fairly simple cut out of one panel. An alternative option is to cut the outlet hole out right from the middle of a panel, generally using a hand held angle grinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finish&lt;/strong&gt; - once the cuts are made and the stacked stone backsplash installed around the outlets, the final step is finishing the outlets and switches with outlet covers. Existing outlet covers can always be used, or a variety of covers can be sourced from online merchants in various finishes including metal and stone, which could be used to accent or blend into the installation. If you’ve chosen to extend the outlets to have them sit close to flush with the stone, your finishing steps might also include some precision chiseling or detail work with an angle grinder to get the covers to sit flush against the face of the stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a stacked stone backsplash is on your list of must haves, don’t let the prospect of working around the outlets and switches deter you! Using some basic stone and tile installation principles, and a few tricks unique to the product, you’ll be on your way to enjoying your backsplash in no time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary>Whether it's charging up your phone or setting the mood with lighting, outlets and switches are a necessary and important part of many kitchen and bath backsplashes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Travertine-Tile-French-Pattern.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Travertine tile french pattern&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;font-weight:lighter;letter-spacing:1px&quot;&gt;You probably see Travertine everyday without knowing it.&lt;/span&gt; It is used for flooring, wall features, pool decks, walkways, steps, fireplaces, patios and even driveways. Travertine is Limestone that has been put under immense pressure for a long time. Travertine eventually morphs into Marble if that pressure continues to be applied. It is available in numerous grades, finishes &amp;amp; formats. While Travertine can be made into pavers, its most common format is tiles. Travertine tiles themselves come in a variety of cuts, patterns, shapes and sizes, ranging from 4” x 4”, 6” x 6”, 12” x 12” all the way up to 24” x 24”. The reason you see this material everywhere is because of it versatility. It is sure to fit any project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Travertine-Tile-Bathroom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Travertine tile bathroom&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;Travertine tiles are one of the most frequently used materials in modern architecture. Since the color is neutral beige with some variation, it coordinates nicely with other basics and even plays well with fun pops of color. Travertine tiles can either be the star of the show or can fade into the background, allowing other aspects of the space to shine. Some of the knocks on Travertine are that it can scratch easily and can be susceptible to staining if not sealed properly, even via the mildest of acids like vinegar and orange juice. Polished and sealed Travertine can also be slippery when wet. However, most often any problem related to Travertine is often a result of the incorrect finish being used for the application. Always consult a flooring expert when selecting any type of tile to make sure the tile’s physical properties and attributes meet the demands of the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Travertine-Tile-Pool-Deck.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Travertine tile pool deck&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;Due to their simplicity, Travertine tiles pair well with other natural materials. For example in the pictured application, Norstone’s &lt;a href=&quot;/products/rock-panels/white/&quot;&gt;natural stone rock panels in White&lt;/a&gt; are used as a waterline tile and spa surround in this mid century South Florida home. The light colored tumbled travertine used for the pool decking and coping is a popular choice for this type of application because of its texture and color pallet. At Norstone, we see travertine frequently paired with our White and &lt;a href=&quot;/products/rock-panels/ivory/&quot;&gt;Ivory Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt;, particularly when a customer is looking for a finishing piece, such as a cap for a landscape knee wall, or the flat hearth surface of a freshly renovated fireplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Travertine is a tried and true friend when it comes to decorating and remodeling. It is a safe, no fail option if you are overwhelmed with the choices and not sure what to choose. Travertine tiles provide a neutral pallet to build off of and design around.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Tumbled-Stone-Pavers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tumbled stone pavers&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;font-weight:lighter;letter-spacing:1px&quot;&gt;In today’s design world there are practically no limits to what can be used as a decorative surface material.&lt;/span&gt; Metal, glass, wood, and stone are just a few primary categories of materials, each with a multitude of different finishes that they can be prepared in. For today’s topic, let’s concentrate on stone and more specifically tumbled stone. Tumbled stone’s popularity comes from the fact that it helps create the weathered old world look that adds an air of classiness and establishment to any project, and lends itself towards a variety of residential and commercial applications including kitchens, bathrooms, offices, retail and hospitality projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Tumbled-Stone-Shower-Floor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tumbled stone shower floor&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt; Tumbled stone products start life as large stones that have been quarried, rough cut, and shipped to fabricators who cut down those large blocks of stone into smaller slabs, pavers, or tiles. The stone is then placed into large drums along with grit, crushed stones, water, and other abrasives and spun according to the fabricator’s “recipe” for what look they are hoping to achieve. Everything inside the drum will rub and wear against the stone until the fabricator gets the desired tumbled effect or finish they want. Post tumbling, much can be done to diversify this design style. Larger stones can be cut into smooth rounded milky tiles or smaller stones like gemstones and river rocks can be placed onto backers and paired with other materials such as glass for a more colorful finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Tumbed-Stone-with-Rock-Panels.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tumbled stone with rock panels&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;The old-world charm of tumbled stone offers the opportunity to create a professional look with a very unique style for interior and exterior projects. These classic tile or rounded stone accent surfaces offer meticulous artistry and design applications limited only by your imagination. The myriad of color choices, the patterns, and the materials can be combined to build a true work of art that will accent any space whether traditional or modern. For the team here at Norstone, the tumbled look is something we appreciate very much. Being in direct contrast to the sharp, geometric lines of our &lt;a href=&quot;/products/stacked-stone-cladding/&quot;&gt;Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/products/modern-wall-tile/&quot;&gt;Basalt Tiles&lt;/a&gt;, it expands our horizons on different ways stone can be finished and how different finishes can be paired to achieve a seamless look, such as the photo you see here where our Ivory Rock Panel is paired with a tumbled travertine to border a pizza oven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any trend, the tumbled stone look is bound to ebb and flow from the fancy of designers and trend setters in the natural stone industry. Fabricators and manufacturers will continue to push forward with new twists on the tumbled look and more efficient ways to process. Designers will then find unique ways to use it to create environments pleasing to their clients. So next time a classic old world design project happens across your desk, think about finding a spot to use tumbled stone, from the floors to the walls and everything in between!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary>Tumbled Stone is to polished marble as those $500 &quot;vintage&quot; designer jeans are to a brand new pair of Levis.

&lt;p&gt;This Austrian house is a fully-furnished, fully-functional home tucked away into a hillside with absolutely breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains. The structure blends the comforts of a traditional house with the futurism of contemporary design. Set on stilts, it is built to maximize spectacular views while minimizing the environmental impact of its construction, a design choice rarely seen outside of beach communities. Windows, both small and large, provide light to every part of the building without sacrificing personal privacy, a consideration that’s often missed in the design of compact houses. The interior of the house is fairly minimal in style, dominated by a single wood finish and accented by clever little details in each room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Slate-Tile-Norstone-Firepit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Slate tile Norstone firepit&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:16px;font-weight:lighter;letter-spacing:1px&quot;&gt; Slate is a generalized term in the natural stone industry, and can take on a whole lot of different meanings depending on who you talk to.&lt;/span&gt; Many people refer to any naturally cleft stone in the grey - brown color family, be it for flooring or wall cladding, as slate. Norstone’s &lt;a href=&quot;/products/rock-panels/charcoal&quot;&gt;Charcoal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/products/rock-panels/ochre/&quot;&gt;Ochre Blend&lt;/a&gt; Rock Panels are often confused for slate, although neither of them actually contain slate, which is a dense, but soft, fine grained metamorphic rock. Slate itself can vary in terms of its physical properties depending on what quarrying region it comes from, which includes both North and South America, and Asia. Although wildly popular for both interior and exterior uses, slate does have its limitations, including certain varieties that tend to be softer, thus more susceptible to scratching and flaking / powdering with use, as well as other varieties which have high absorption rates and shouldn’t be used for exterior applications in freeze / thaw climates. Always work with a knowledgeable stone expert when buying slate and discuss what you plan to use it for to make sure the type of slate you’re buying is a good match for the job. Once installed, there are a few easy tips to remember when maintaining slate tile and other natural stone tile products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing any natural stone owner or caretaker should do is consider sealing their stone. Water based sealers are going to be recommended for most slate tiles and other natural stone materials and not only afford the stone a layer of protection against the elements, but can also be used to achieve certain looks, including high gloss or “wet look” finishes. It’s important to test any natural stone sealer on a sample piece, off cut, or in an inconspicuous place on the installation to verify the results before applying the sealer over the entire application. Sealing will provide your slate tile or other natural stone tiles with the best pro-active protection available.  The photo below shows the difference between unsealed slate tile and tiles that have been sealed with a color enhancing sealer.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/Natural-Stone-Tile-Stain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone stone tile stain&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;When the inevitable call for clean up does occur, be it a spilled glass of wine or junior dropping his bowl of spaghetti off his high-chair, the first and most important step is to take action as quickly as possible. Slate Tiles and most other natural stone tiles are porous and will soak up liquid spills. Immediately triage by wiping up the spill with a paper towel and then use either a detergent based cleaner or a specially formulated natural stone cleaner to tackle deep staining. Remember that slate tiles, depending on their origin, can be soft, so clean using a plastic bristle brush to avoid any surface scratching and most importantly do not use any acidic cleaners, including citrus based products, or scouring products which can cause damage to the stone. It’s always going to be a good idea to reseal an area that just underwent a thorough cleaning as the cleaning likely removed or greatly decreased the efficacy of the sealer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect slate tile and other natural stone tile products to continue to be sought after for the unique one of a kind natural look that can’t be re-created in a factory. With a few simple steps and knowledge of how to care for these types of products, slate and other natural stone floor and wall coverings not only make sense but become very appealing to the discerning customer looking to set their project apart. So go ahead and use a natural stone tile for your next project - you’ll thank us later!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary>Slate tile and other sedimentary based stone tiles are wildly popular due to their range of colors, ease of use, and in many instances, great value.
